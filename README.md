# DS1388 library for Arduino & ESP32

a library to provide high level APIs to interface with the Analog Sevices (formerly Maxim) Real-time [DS1388](https://www.analog.com/en/products/ds1388.html) Clock. For Energia support, look at the original library.

Forked from [https://github.com/DelfiSpace/DS1388](https://github.com/DelfiSpace/DS1388) and made Arduino/ESP32 compatible by Jenschr. Added a way to get the hundredths/centiseconds. Did not add code to use Eeprom or temp yet.
